        <p>The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow (in contrast to absolute positioning).</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Note: If you're referring to this property from JavaScript as a member of the HTMLElement.style object, modern browsers support float, but in older browsers you have to spell it as cssFloat. This was an exception to the rule, that the name of the DOM member is the camel-case name of the dash-separated CSS name (because "float" is a reserved word in JavaScript, as seen in the need to escape "class" as "className" and escape <label>'s "for" as "htmlFor").</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>As mentioned above, when an element is floated, it is taken out of the normal flow of the document (though still remaining part of it). It is shifted to the left, or right, until it touches the edge of its containing box, or another floated element.</p>
